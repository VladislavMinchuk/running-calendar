      <h1>About training plan</h1>
      <p>Surely you are familiar with the situation: you start running "from Monday", and a week later there is no trace of your previous desire. Oh, yes - we went through it ourselves. Many start to run often and quickly, suffocate, try to "break themselves", demonstrate willpower. And soon they quit, not understanding how this masochism can be liked by anyone.</p>
      <p>But the real willpower is to build up the load gradually and run as much as you can, without worrying about "what people think." At the same time, attention should be paid not to the speed of the run, but to its duration.</p>
      <p>This training plan is for those who want to start running and not quit, and it will take you on an exciting journey from the couch to your first 5km run. Put on your sneakers - and go!</p>
