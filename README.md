# Running Planner

A simple **Vue.js** application with a datepicker and tabs. A user can select a date, based on which the training program for the 5 km race is calculated. The program consists of 16 days, during which the duration and distance gradually increases up to five kilometers. The project is made with **Vuex**. I used **Vue Tasty Burgers** for hamburger menu button on mobile.
